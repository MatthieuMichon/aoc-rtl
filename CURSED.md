- Verilator and GTKWave have trouble agreeing on a common time base.
- Reducing the TCK clock period in the testbench from 20ns to 10ps yields a **massive** increase in simulation speed.
  - Day 1.1 simulates in less than 0.5 seconds down from eight minutes.
  - *There must be a better/proper way to do this.*: there is indeed, removing the half-cycle delay and replacing it with a single-cycle delay `#1`.
- As of late 2025, Yosys doesn't support 2d arrays
- `run_state_hw_jtag -state IDLE IDLE` does not cycle `tck` (related [support request](https://adaptivesupport.amd.com/s/question/0D5Pd00001772mvKAA/) and [repository](https://github.com/MatthieuMichon/vivado_jtag_run-test-idle))
- dual-port RAM inference has some side effects, some corner cases may exhibit different behavior between simulation and synthesis
- Modulo arithmetics are cursed, even worse with using signed integers
- Using a dot `.` in a directory name is asking for trouble (upsets the Python debugger in Zed)
- Beware of mismatches due to non initialized enum types
- Vivado `cs_server` may be left running, ending up spinning-up one CPU core for absolutely no reason
- Model and verify intuitions before committing to them
- Deep pipelining fills FPGAs real fast and require optimized simulation testbenchs
- Each tool has limitations with regards to SystemVerilog constructs, all of them must be frequently invoked for avoiding lengthy code rewrites
- Be careful using the signals from BSCANE2 instances, **always** check that the `SEL` output is asserted. Check this repository for more details: [https://github.com/MatthieuMichon/bscan-waves](https://github.com/MatthieuMichon/bscan-waves)
- All Vivado synthesis generating a Synth 8-87 warning must be terminated with extreme prejudice
- The design behavior must be checked with all three simulators
- Verilator is able to store string values (for FSM states) for enums in FST dump
- Beware of integer division in SystemVerilog which discards the decimal part, the trick is to multiple by `1.0` prior to dividing, ie. `int'($ceil(1.0*COLS/COLS_PER_RAM))`
