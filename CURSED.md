- Reducing the TCK clock period in the testbench from 20ns to 10ps yields a **massive** increase in simulation speed.
  - Day 1.1 simulates in less than 0.5 seconds down from eight minutes.
  - *There must be a better/proper way to do this.*: there is indeed, removing the half-cycle delay and replacing it with a single-cycle delay `#1`.
- As of late 2025, Yosys doesn't support 2d arrays
- `run_state_hw_jtag -state IDLE IDLE` does not cycle `tck`
