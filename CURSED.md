- Verilator and GTKWave have trouble agreeing on a common time base.
- Reducing the TCK clock period in the testbench from 20ns to 10ps yields a **massive** increase in simulation speed.
  - Day 1.1 simulates in less than 0.5 seconds down from eight minutes.
  - *There must be a better/proper way to do this.*: there is indeed, removing the half-cycle delay and replacing it with a single-cycle delay `#1`.
- As of late 2025, Yosys doesn't support 2d arrays
- `run_state_hw_jtag -state IDLE IDLE` does not cycle `tck` (related [support request](https://adaptivesupport.amd.com/s/question/0D5Pd00001772mvKAA/) and [repository](https://github.com/MatthieuMichon/vivado_jtag_run-test-idle))
- dual-port RAM inference has some side effects, some corner cases may exhibit different behavior between simulation and synthesis
